# Best Practices

- Write fully documented code. Documentation is extremely important because no one wants to look at source code and waste time figuring out how to use a software. 
- Write readable and easy to maintain code. 
- Be consistent! The more consistent the code base is in naming, formatting, structure, etc., the easier it is to jump into arbitrary code and understand it.
- Do incremental refactoring to improve code maintainability.
